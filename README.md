# Project Heisenberg
Solving prescription/pharmaceutical logistics using smart contracts

[title](https://www.exampleUserFlow.jpg)

Project Heisenberg is a decentralized identity management system built atop a permissioned Ethereum consortium network.  The goal of this project is to completely eliminate the possibility of perscription fraud.

By creating a decentralized smart-contract standard that defines the method for ownership and transferribility of a perscription we have solved a variety of problems.
  1. The possibility of counterfit/forged perscriptions is eliminated
  2. An immutable record of the movement, quantity, identity, etc. of perscriptions is created
  3. The possibilty for regulatory insight into the quantity, concentration, movement, etc. of drugs is enabled
  4. Communication and trust between doctors, patients, and pharmaceys is improved
  
Project Heisenberg accomplishes this goal through the tokenization of pharmacuetical perscriptions into an ERC-721 solidity contract standar.  This non-fungible token carries metadata describing the doctor ID, the patient's public key, the drug RX Id, and the unit quantity to be dispensed.

The code for the non-fungible script is hosted here (link.).  It is currently deployed on a test network, but could also be deployed on Mainnet for wallet interoperabillity, etc.

The defined roles for this project scenario are as follows:
  1. Doctor
  2. Patient
  3. Pharmacy
